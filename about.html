            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <div class="p-wrapper">
                  <p>I may also term it love. I clearly remember the day when my father came home bringing our
                    first computer. I pressed the button and the instant the screen lit a spark came off and woke
                    my imagination and inspired myriads of ideas.</p>
                  <p>When I was in the fifth form, I got initiated into web hosting, basic HTML, CSS and PHP. I was
                    taking participation in maths and computing contests and somehow I kept feeling that this was
                    my path of development. Along the recent years, I never stopped building up my skills further.
                    I received prizes in many team contests organized by JuniorAchievementBulgaria and at the
                    beginning of the tenth form school year I became a member of the robotics club at school. It
                    was then that the LEGO Mindstorms platform offered to me an easy and understandable way to
                    assemble robots, and subsequently I faced the challenge of working with ZumoRobots with
                    Arduino and Pololu 3pi Robot regarding microprocessors, electricity and voltage; all issues we
                    studied in the Physics classes. On 6th June 2016 our team won the First Prize in the 2D
                    Labyrinth at 2016 Festival of Robotics and Mechatronics. Things within the frame of those
                    platforms do have their limits of development and regarding categories of higher competitive
                    level, I needed something new. I started designing my own robots, spent countless hours at the
                    whiteboard and at the testing sites. That is how at the same contest in 2016 in the category
                    LINE TRACKING my Usain Bolt brought me the Third Prize amidst competitors from Bulgaria and
                    Romania.</p>
                    <p>At RuseCodeWeek 2016 I together with two other boys decided to be part of the event. We
                    attended an online course carried out by openSAP and received LEGO Mindstorms certificates.
                    That way I, as a lecturer at the local university, conducted a number of tasks that led to the
                    realization of interesting ideas from children's thoughts.</p>
                    <p>The time spent in writing software developed my logical and creative way of thinking and
                    programming in itself served as a foundation in contests to come. I was attending a number of
                    courses and conferences such as the one held by Startup Factory where upon completion I was
                    awarded a certificate of WEB development using PHP. The project I run there was titled Olble
                    -an online customizable website builder. Besides, during the three-day hackathon Ruse Hack
                    2.0, I was able to realize to a considerable extent my idea for an online machine for
                    management of family financial and business needs. Apart from the First Prize winning, I was
                    also awarded two special prizes in category Design by WebVox and Programista. My online-based
                    projects constitute a significant part of my works and the one I am currently engaged with is
                    titled toppynews - a platform for personalized RSS news.</p>
                    <p>Currently I have run into difficulties finding motivated people, yet for me the key to success
                    is the headlong teamwork and long-term activities. Large web projects require just that and
                    for someone like me this poses an enormous obstacle. I do believe that the UK is the place
                    where such ambitious people and bright minds come from all across the world. In addition, the
                    competitive environment is of crucial importance in the age of technological innovation. Last,
                    but not least in importance, with the latest cutting-edge academic knowledge my endeavors
                    would certainly be brought to realization.</p>
                    <p>My inner eye beholds a world where there is an ever-growing demand for software - starting
                    with electric automobiles and web applications and extending to IoT (Internet of Things) with
                    the myriads of gadgets destined to join the global web. As for me, I take it that the software
                    engineer proper is a kind of inventor, a person who believes in his or her ideas and realizes
                    them. Elon Musk is one of that kind - solutions seeker and a down-to-earth businessman. With
                    his enthusiasm and potential, he stands for the word inspiration to me. Actually,
                    opportunities are waiting round each corner and I am adamant about making the best of them.</p>
