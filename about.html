            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <div class="p-wrapper">
                  <p>I may also term it love. I clearly remember the day when my father came home, bringing our first computer. I pressed the button and the instant the screen lit a spark came off and woke my imagination and inspired myriads of ideas.</p>
                  <p>When I was in the fifth form, I got initiated into web hosting, basic HTML, CSS and PHP. I participated in maths and computing contests, and somehow I felt that this was my development path. Along the recent years, I never stopped building up my skills further. I received prizes in many team contests organized by JuniorAchievementBulgaria, and at the beginning of the tenth form school year, I became a member of the robotics club at school. It was then that the LEGO Mindstorms platform offered to me an easy and understandable way to assemble robots, and subsequently, I faced the challenge of working with ZumoRobots with Arduino and Pololu 3pi Robot regarding microprocessors, electricity and voltage; all issues we studied in the Physics classes. On 6th June 2016, our team won the First Prize in the 2D Labyrinth at 2016 Festival of Robotics and Mechatronics. Things within the frame of those platforms do have their limits of development, and regarding categories of higher competitive level, I needed something new. I started designing my own robots, spent countless hours at the whiteboard and at the testing sites. That is how at the same contest in 2016 in the category LINE TRACKING my Usain Bolt brought me the Third Prize amidst competitors from Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
                    <p>At RuseCodeWeek 2016, I, together with two other boys, decided to be part of the event. We attended an online course carried out by openSAP and received LEGO Mindstorms certificates. That way, I, as a lecturer at the local university, conducted a number of tasks that led to the realization of interesting ideas from children's thoughts.</p>
                    <p>The time spent in writing software developed my logical and creative way of thinking and programming in itself served as a foundation in contests to come. I was attending a number of courses and conferences such as the one held by Startup Factory, where upon completion, I was awarded a certificate of WEB development using PHP. The project I run there was titled Olble -an online customisable website builder. Besides, during the three-day hackathon Ruse Hack 2.0, I realised to a considerable extent my idea for an online machine for management of family financial and business needs. Apart from the First Prize-winning, I was also awarded two special prizes in category Design by WebVox and Programista. My online-based projects constitute a significant part of my works.</p>
                    <p>The key to success is the headlong teamwork and long-term activities. A competitive environment is of crucial importance in the age of technological innovation.  Large web projects require just that, and I believe that the UK is where such ambitious people and bright minds come from all across the world. </p>

            <h3>Studying in Scotland</h3>
            <div class="p-wrapper">
                  <p>I have moved to Aberdeen in the autumn of 2020. In fact, this beautiful city was my first choice when I applied through the UCAS platform in 2018. During my first two years in Scotland, I have studied BSc Computing Science at the University of Dundee. I did not allow a decimal point from my school grades to distant myself from the honour of studying at the university of my first desire, and I managed to successfully transfer to MSci Computing Science with Industrial Placement (5-year program) at the University of Aberdeen. Currently, I am in my third year, and I am in the process of actively seeking internship prospects as my fourth year. I believe that opportunities are waiting around each corner and I am adamant about making the best of them. </p>
				  <p>Since my childhood, I find myself interested in the whole spectrum of Computing Science. I have always been keen to apply the knowledge gained from university and learn how cloud-based solutions can benefit companies interpret their valuable data and turn it into useful information. I can adapt to new environments and changes, create, manage and integrate into motivated teams, quickly develop new skills and gain a solid understanding of software solutions architecture. I am determined to dedicate the whole of my potential and take the responsibility to deliver an exceptional level of service.</p>
				  <p>During the summer of 2018, I have got the opportunity to get an insight into the IT department of Econt Express Ltd - one of the biggest courier companies in my country (internationally well-known in Romania and Greece). For me, it was such an invaluable experience. Every week I was given a list of tasks to complete and knowledge to gain until the end of the week. I was introduced to Transact-SQL and Power BI - powerful skills I still use today. I was given access to the database so that I can work and practice the knowledge I gained. My work consisted namely in the form of creating Power BI reports which in a user-friendly and interactive way represent the data queried by me from multiple big database tables. The data set was several gigabytes in size and contained every single bit of information regarding delivery, tracking, customers, dispatchers and so on. This gave me an early in life insight into the field of Big Data Analysis. I had the opportunity to be supervised by the director of the company. He exposed me to valuable knowledge and experience from the point of view of someone who leads a company. I was also allowed to join weekly meetings with external companies and in first-person witness the negotiation process of any future improvements to the courier system. </p>
				  <p>My inner eye beholds a world where there is an ever-growing demand for software - starting with electric automobiles, web applications, advanced medical research and the myriads of gadgets (IoT) destined to join the global web. As for me, I take it that a software engineer proper is a kind of inventor, a person who believes in the project idea and realises it. </p>
				  <p>About a year ago, I dived into the topic of AI and ML. I have opened my eyes and realised that AI is inevitable in our society, and I have been dedicating my education to that ever since. I believe that opportunities are waiting around each corner, and I am adamant about making the best of them.</p>
				  <p>At the moment, I am quickly gaining experience on the following topics as part of a university project: Thermal Image Analysis, Validation, Identification, Recognition and Interpretation using Apache Cassandra, Java-ML and OpenCV. I can contribute to the company by applying the knowledge I will gain by the end of the second sub-session. In addition to my analytical thinking, I can demonstrate soundness in C++, Java, C#, some Python and (non-)relational databases such as Apache MySQL and Cassandra. Additionally, to my coding skills, I have notable knowledge in Mathematics, motivation to develop and absorb new information, as a part of a study group or individually. </p>
				  <p>When treating one or more medical conditions within a patient, it is commonplace for them to be prescribed more than one drug for treatment, referred to as polypharmacy. Combinations of drugs are known to create unique side effects and/or increase the frequency of particular side effects manifesting. I have contributed to the creation of a solution to this problem by finding the common side effects for drug combinations to help the patient understand the risk factors of taking drug combinations and the possible side effects they could experience. I have helped during all stages of the project but most notably in the phase of analysing the dataset and coding the software. DecagonAI produces a graph containing the drugs that a patient is taking and it highlights the ’at risk’ symptoms (the common side effects). This gives everyone involved with the patient’s treatment a better idea of what they can expect to happen from the process. </p>
				  <p>In the most recent project, I have contributed throughout all software production stages. ThermAnalyser is designed to detect and interpret thermal inefficiencies in car engines and wheels. It is an innovative solution that aims to help car mechanics diagnose overheating or underheating of car parts by using accurate measurements and artificial intelligence to present a list of possible issues. This project up to this stage has a complete initial technical report, white paper and a working prototype. The proof of concept is focused on enhancing our understanding of the concepts we are going to tackle in the second semester (Machine Learning, Image processing, Computer vision). The prototype aims to show the many approaches we could take to segment the image and classify the detected objects within the frame. Overall, it turned out that we are a cohesive team, and all members participate readily and this, even more, motivates me to accomplish the set goals.</p>
